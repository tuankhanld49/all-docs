User Story: Standardize Navigation and Data Passing in Microfrontend Application
Title: As a developer, I want to standardize navigation and data passing between pages in the microfrontend application so that I can ensure correct data is passed to destination pages and reduce errors.

Description:

In our React microfrontend application, we have a shell application that hosts multiple miniapps. Users navigate between pages (defined in a webPath object, e.g., {'path1': '/path1', 'path2': '/path2'}) across these miniapps. Currently, navigation is handled using a navigate function that passes data via appData stored in the shell’s context. However, the lack of clear data requirements for each destination page leads to errors where required data is missing or incorrect, making it hard to debug and maintain, especially since destination pages can be accessed from multiple source pages. We need a solution to define specific appData requirements for each path, validate data during navigation, and make it easy to refactor the large number of existing paths.

As a: Developer

I want to: Standardize the navigation process and data passing for each path in the microfrontend application

So that: I can ensure destination pages receive the correct and required data, reduce runtime errors, improve debugging, and refactor the existing paths efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:

Path Registry Definition:
A centralized pathRegistry is created to map each path key (e.g., path1, path2) to its actual path (e.g., /path1, /path2) and the required/optional appData fields.
Example: For path1, required fields might be userId and orderId, with theme as optional.
The pathRegistry must be defined using TypeScript interfaces to enforce type safety.
The registry must support dynamic updates, allowing new paths to be added or modified without changing the core navigation logic.
Navigation Function Update:
The navigate function in the shell’s context is updated to accept a pathKey (e.g., path1) and an appData object containing required and optional fields.
The function validates that all required fields (as defined in pathRegistry) are present and of the correct type (e.g., userId must be a string) before navigating.
If validation fails, an error is logged to the console with details (e.g., missing fields, incorrect types), and navigation is prevented.
The appData is stored in the context under the destination path’s key for easy retrieval by the destination page.
Data Access in Destination Pages:
Destination pages retrieve appData from the shell’s context using the current pathname (from react-router-dom).
If required data is missing or invalid, the destination page displays a user-friendly error message (e.g., “Missing required userId”) instead of crashing.
Pages are wrapped in an ErrorBoundary to prevent crashes and display user-friendly error messages with instructions for recovery (e.g., “Please return to the previous page and try again”).
Refactoring Existing Paths:
A process is provided to quickly convert the existing webPath object (e.g., {'path1': '/path1', 'path2': '/path2'}) into the new pathRegistry format, either manually or via a script.
The solution minimizes changes to existing navigation calls (e.g., navigate('/path1', ...) to navigate('path1', { required: {...} })).
A script or guideline is provided to assist with refactoring a large number of paths, ensuring minimal disruption to the existing codebase.
The refactoring process includes a validation step to identify paths with missing or incomplete appData definitions during development.
Debugging Support:
The navigate function logs detailed information (e.g., path key, destination path, provided appData, and validation results) to the console for debugging.
Logs include a timestamp and the source page (if provided in appData) to trace navigation flows.
A debug mode can be enabled to display warnings for optional fields that are commonly used but missing, helping developers identify potential issues early.
Errors in destination pages (e.g., missing appData) are logged with context (e.g., current path, expected fields) to facilitate troubleshooting.
Type Safety and Developer Experience:
TypeScript types are enforced for pathKey and appData to provide autocompletion and type checking in IDEs (e.g., VSCode) when calling navigate.
Example: Typing navigate('path1', ...) should suggest userId and orderId as required fields.
JSDoc comments or documentation is provided for the navigate function and pathRegistry to guide developers on required/optional fields for each path.
A utility function or script is provided to generate TypeScript types from pathRegistry to ensure consistency across the codebase.
Scalability for Microfrontend Architecture:
The solution supports microfrontend architecture by allowing pathRegistry to be shared across the shell and miniapps (e.g., via Module Federation or a shared module).
Miniapps can access pathRegistry to validate their own navigation calls without direct dependency on the shell’s implementation.
The navigate function supports nested routes within miniapps (e.g., /path1/subpath) by allowing pathRegistry to define sub-paths with their own appData requirements.
Handling Edge Cases:
If a pathKey is not found in pathRegistry, the navigate function logs an error and prevents navigation to avoid broken routes.
If a destination page is accessed directly (e.g., via URL or browser refresh), the page checks for missing appData and redirects to a fallback page (e.g., homepage) or displays an error message.
The solution handles cases where the same destination page is accessed from multiple source pages with different appData requirements by allowing pathRegistry to define context-specific required fields (e.g., path1 from MiniApp1 vs. MiniApp2).
Performance Optimization:
The navigate function minimizes context updates by only storing necessary appData for the destination path, avoiding bloated context state.
The pathRegistry is loaded efficiently (e.g., as a static object or lazy-loaded for large registries) to avoid performance overhead in the shell.
Navigation performance is monitored by logging the time taken for validation and context updates, with a threshold (e.g., <10ms) to ensure no noticeable delays.
Testing and Validation:
Unit tests are provided for the navigate function to verify validation logic (e.g., missing required fields, incorrect types).
Integration tests ensure that navigation between miniapps passes the correct appData and that destination pages handle missing data gracefully.
A test script is provided to validate the pathRegistry for completeness (e.g., no duplicate paths, all required fields defined).
A linter rule or TypeScript check is implemented to warn developers if they call navigate with an undefined pathKey.
Notes
These additional acceptance criteria enhance the user story by addressing developer experience (type safety, documentation), scalability (microfrontend support, nested routes), edge cases (direct access, multiple sources), performance, and testing. They ensure the solution is robust and maintainable for a large codebase with many paths.
The criteria are designed to align with your need for a quick refactor (e.g., via scripts, minimal changes) and to reduce errors in navigation and data passing.
